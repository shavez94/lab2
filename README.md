Breast Cancer Wisconsin Machine Learning Models
This repository contains two machine learning models developed to predict breast cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset. The models implemented are Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

Dataset
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset consists of features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast mass. 

Models: 

Logistic Regression
The logistic regression model utilizes a linear regression algorithm with a logistic function to predict the probability of a sample being benign or malignant.
Accuracy: 95%

Random Forest Classifier:
The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
Accuracy: 96%
